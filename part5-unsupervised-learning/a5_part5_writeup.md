# Part 5 - Unsupervised Learning Writeup

After completing `a6_part5.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Develop a name for each customer group based on the information from the graph. For example, one group might be called “Frugal” while another might be called “Shopaholic.” Explain your reasoning for each label.
Blue Cluster (Low Income, High Score): Fakers because they want to look rich but actually don't make much money
Red Cluster (High Income, High Score): Material Girls (and guys) because they are rich and spend a lot on physical items
Green Cluster (Medium Income, Medium Score): Working Class because this is the classic in-the-middle group
Purple Cluster (Low Income, Low Score): Hardworking because although they have low income, they are not spending it on materialistic items and will have more income for those physics things in the future (eyes on the prize people)
Orange Cluster (High Income, Low Score): Stuck in the Past because they probably had no money before they got rich and still have a habit of not spending money on shopping items. I will give them a lot of credit though because they are probably smart and want to spend their money on more important things like family.

2. What group would a customer who has a medium income and low spending habits be in?
The borders of the orange cluster (high income, low score).

3. Choose one cluster of interest to you. How might the marketing team approach this specific customer group?
For the red cluster (high income, high score), all you need to do is make something flashy and they will probably buy it. The item can even be overpriced, but this cluster will still biuy it because they have high income and most likely care about status. For example, make a Rolex watch and slap it on a billboard and boom, you're a millionare (this is slightly exaggerated).
