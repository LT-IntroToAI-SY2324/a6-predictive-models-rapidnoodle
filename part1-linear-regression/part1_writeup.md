# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this linear regression model?
The r squared value is 0.6257932855322315 and it says how well the best fit line 'fits' the model. In this case, there is a noticeable trend.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person who is 43 years old?
The predicted systolic blood pressure for someone who is 43 years old is 137.46185286.

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
Since there are not too many data points on the graph, it wouldn't be the most accurate prediction to determine someone's blood pressure, however it could give a rough estimate. However, I would not consider it reliable and I would improve it by adding way more data points because in AI, data is power.
